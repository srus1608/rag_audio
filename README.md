## 🎧🔍 RAG-based Audio QA System 🤖
Unlock insights from audio files with AI! 🚀 This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project allows users to ask questions based on audio content and receive AI-generated answers, making it perfect for analyzing podcasts, interviews, or lectures.

## ⚙️ How It Works
🎵 Audio Upload: User uploads an audio file (mp3, wav).
✂️ Transcription: Audio is transcribed into text using speech-to-text APIs.
🧠 Embedding Creation: Text chunks are converted to embeddings.
🗄️ Storage: Embeddings are stored in PostgreSQL for efficient searching.
💬 Q&A: AI retrieves relevant parts and answers user queries.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
HTML, CSS, JS 🎨 (Frontend)
PostgreSQL 🐘 (Database for embeddings)
LangChain 🦜🔗 (RAG pipeline)
Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Whisper, Google STT)
LLMs (OpenAI, Llama2, etc.)

## ✨ Features
✅ Ask questions directly from audio content.
✅ Fast, accurate responses.
✅ Beautiful user interface.
✅ Efficient backend with PostgreSQL.
